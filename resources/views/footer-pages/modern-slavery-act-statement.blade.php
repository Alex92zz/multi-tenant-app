                        <h4>Introduction from the Directors</h4>
                        <p>FMV Group Ltd is committed to improving our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking. We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and we strive to act ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.</p>
                        <h4>Our Business</h4>
                        <p>Our annual turnover is currently significantly below the reporting threshold of £36M as set by the Government, therefore FMV have no legal requirement to publish a Statement. However, the Company wishes to communicate a Statement under the Act, to support other Business’s and professions in the Utility industry that do have an obligation to publish a Statement.</p>
                        <h4>Our policy on anti-slavery and human trafficking</h4>
                        <p>We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Anti-slavery and Human Trafficking Policy reflect our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls.</p>
                        <p>We will treat any breach of our Anti-slavery and Human Trafficking Policy very seriously. Any employee who breaches the policy will face disciplinary action which could result in dismissal for misconduct or gross misconduct.</p>
                        <h4>Supplier adherence to our policies</h4>
                        <p>As part of our contracting processes we require our suppliers to comply with our policy, which includes specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labour or anyone held in slavery or servitude (whether adults or children), and we expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards. Any failure by a supplier to meet the standards set out will be a breach of contract and may result in the termination of our relationship with them. We use the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) as its guide on this policy.</p>
                        <h4>Flowlee’s continued commitment</h4>
                        <p>We recognise the importance of maintaining constant vigilance to identify and address any issues associated with slavery and human trafficking in FMV and throughout our supply chains. We are committed to continuing to enhance our capacity to identify, prevent and mitigate any actual or potential risks in these areas.</p>
                        <p>This statement is made pursuant to section 54 (Part 6) of the Act. It has been reviewed and approved by both FMV Group Directors.</p>
