                                Many electromagnetic meters (EM) are replaced unnecessarily when there are issues regarding data quality and operability. Once an EM stops recording or sending data it is often not a terminal failure but a temporary issue which can be rectified. Such issues could be:

                                The more modern meters have all settings stored in the meter head itself, this makes each transmitter replaceable. Once a transmitter head is damaged it is often assumed that the meter needs to be replaced, this is not the case. Flowlee are able to carry out like-for-like replacements of both battery and mains powered units, upgrades to newer versions, replacement of meter and logger cables.

                                This service also extends to Electromagnetic Insertion Probes which operate with similar equipment and, therefore, similar issues. An extra service provided for insertion probes is the option to remove the probe and install as new, completing a velocity profile and fixing the point correctly in the main. Flowlee can also offer a calibration service for insertion probes.

                            <h4 class="bm-10 mt-30">Applications</h4>

                            <p>
                                EM meters are often installed in locations that do not allow for an easy removal and replacement process, many installed over the years have been buried and often lie under roads or pavements.

                            </p>

                            <br />
                            <p>
                                The cost of replacing an EM meter can run into the tens of thousands and create several operational issues when planning to isolate supplies without a bypass. Simple repairs can be carried out at a fraction of the cost for replacement and extend the life of the meter allowing capital spend to be utilised elsewhere.
