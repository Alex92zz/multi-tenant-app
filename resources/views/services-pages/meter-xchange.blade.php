                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>
                                Where repairing an existing meter is not possible or has not worked and a replacement is either too expensive or creates too much risk FMV has another option for our clients.
                            </p>

                                The Meter Xchange involves removing an EM meter jacket and all the internal electronics, leaving a single flow tube with a clean surface. Flowlee are able to install either a mains powered permanent or battery powered portable ultrasonic flowmeter.

                            </p>

                            <h4 class="bm-10 mt-30">Applications</h4>

                            <p>
                                The Meter Xchange option allows the use of existing assets and chambers removing a high percentage of the cost involved in replacing end of life meters.

                            </p>

                            <br />
                            <p>
                                A Meter Xchange can be completed in nearly all applications, we require an existing end of life meter, and a chamber large enough to operate safely in.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For applications where you are unable to isolate the plant or the flow to remove the in-situ electromagnetic flowmeter
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                FMV engineers will remove the electromagnetic meters outer jacket and external coils, once removed a spool piece is exposed leaving an excellent surface for Ultrasonic transducers to be installed.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                No cutting is involved no hot work permits are required all works are non-intrusive and completed on the outer plastic covering the flow tube section of pipe.
