                                MLD believe that the route to successful leak detection is partly through the use of the best most suitable equipment but primarily it takes the correct working attitude and persistence of its operational staff to work with clients and FMV metering products to target the areas with true leaks and then to be relentless in the pursuit of answers.

                                Accuracy of flow data allows the efficient targeting of areas, removing the risk of discovering dry holes and wasting precious resources in areas with ‘phantom’ leaks.

                                MLD recruit the best teams available to work with clients, not only do these teams have a wealth of experience in leak detection, they have a passion. Leak detection is more than a job for MLD operational staff it’s an obligation as workers in the industry to reduce water losses. MLD will go to great lengths to drive leakage down for both clients and the wider consumer.
